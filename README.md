# Memetic NPC Behavior Toolkit

This is a library based on the concepts brought forth on the NeverWinter Nights' Memetic AI Toolkit by William Bull.

This is not a direct translation of the Memetic AI ToolKit. This is an attempt at using the concepts described in the aforementioned toolkit, into a more generic library for .NET. This is an attempt at creating a C# edition of this brilliant toolkit. It was originally intended to be a WheelMUD-only feature, but it looks to be big enough to warrant its own project.
